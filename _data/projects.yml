- project: A quantum phonon bus for diluted spins interaction

  description: We design the compact diamond OMC cavity to enhance the phonon/photon interaction with the Si vacancy. Owing to the strong confinement of the phononic mode, a strong coupling between phonon and spins is expected. Based on this device scheme, the phonon can be used as the channel to entangle multiple spins regardless of the spin-spin spacing and inhomogeneity. Those results pave the route to further scale up the quantum computing based on solid-state spin systems.
