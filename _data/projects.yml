# jazznotes.io
- project: A quantum phonon bus for diluted spins interaction
  #role: Founder & Primary Developer
  duration: 2022 &mdash; 2023
  # url: "#"
  description: We design the compact SiC OMC cavity to enhance the phonon/photon interaction with the divacancy. Owing to the strong confinement of the phononic mode, a strong coupling between phonon and spins is expected. Based on this device scheme, the phonon can be used as the channel to entangle multiple spins regardless of the spin-spin spacing and inhomogeneity. Those results pave the route to further scale up the quantum computing based on solid-state spin systems.

# jazznotes.io
- project: Engineering of the tunable quantum phonon states in strained 2D quantum dots
  #role: Founder & Primary Developer
  duration: 2021 &mdash; 2022
  # url: "#"
  description: We engineer the local strain to achieve the site-control of the quantum emitter in bilayer WSe2. Owing to the perpendicular dipole moment of the localized interlayer exciton, the emission energy is highly tunable and quantum phonon cascades of quantum emitters are investigated. Also, we are working on the integration of the photonic crystal waveguide to study the collective behaviors of the multiple single-photon emitters.

- project: Transport of 2D exciton with acoustic wave
  #role: Founder & Primary Developer
  duration: 2019 &mdash; 2021
  # url: "#"
  description: We achieve the directional transport of the exciton by the surface acoustic wave (SAW). The SAW on bulk LiNbO3 can interact with the exciton and carry the exciton with a long propagation distance. Also, the exciton behaviors at different regimes have been observed. Our work shows that acoustic waves are an effective, contact-free means to control exciton dynamics and transport, promising for realizing 2D materials-based excitonic devices such as exciton transistors, switches, and transducers.

- project: Separation of the valley exciton-polariton with anisotropic photonic crystal
  #role: Founder & Primary Developer
  duration: 2018 &mdash; 2019
  # url: "#"
  description: We propose an approach to separate valley exciton-polariton with the engineering of the symmetry of the photonic structure, a Rashba-type splitting of polariton dispersion is theoretically predicted.

  # url: "#"
  description: We utilize the strong interlayer coupling of the black Phosphorus (bP), and prototypes of modulator and photodetector based on bP thin films have been demonstrated.
